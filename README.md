# Programming language in python using llvmlite


 This is simply a compiler for a simple language, built with Python 3.6+ and the LLVM framework using the llvmlite library.
 
 ## Features
- **it's fast**, because it should be so, together with LLVM's state of the art optimizations, but it won't ever oblige you to make an extra effort from your side just for the sake of performance
- **it's compiled** using llvmlite
- **it's statically typed** so you don't need to guess the type of the variable if your coworker didn't spend the time to use meaningful names and you can make use of compile-time checks, autocomplete and more
- **it's simple and expressive** because the code should be easily readable and it shouldn't make you guess what it does

Install the requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Code examples

## Comments

/* this is a single line C style comment */

/**

**/

# this is Python
```

## Factorial Function

```
def fact(n:int):int{
    if n <= 1{
        return 1
    }
    return n * fact(n-1)
}

def main():int{
    return fact(6)
}
```

## Conditionals

```
def main():int{

    age = 18
    if age == 18{
        printf('wow you are 18\n')
    }else{
        printf('i guess you are not 18\n')
    }

    return 0
}
```

## Loops

```
def main():int{

    printf('while loop\n')
    x = 0
    while x < 10{
        printf('x = %i\n',x)
        x = x+1
    }

    printf('Until loop\n')

    x = 0
    until x > 10{
        printf('x = %i\n',x)
        x = x+1
    }

    return 0
}
```
